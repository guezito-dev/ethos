That‚Äôs the energy we need.\n\nZero ego, zero filter - just straight-up honest takes in public. That's his whole vibe, and it works.\n\nOnchain Heroes is an Absolute banger. And he's the mastermind behind it.\n\nThe S2 hype was legendary - people were waiting for weeks, and Skarly just played with them the whole time. The \"wen S2\" memes became part of the lore at this point. Classic move from someone who knows exactly what he's doing."
