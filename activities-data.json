He could do a bit better by actually joining the calls when I invite him for a friendly chat </3 but other than that, there's nothing bad I can say. He hosts some pretty cool giveaways on his streams and gets the prizes to winners quickly. Overall, I‚Äôd recommend checking him out whether you‚Äôre just a viewer or someone wanting to show your product to the Abstract crowd."

This reflects the quality and care that Bunya, as a founder, has for the community, which made me truly admire him."
